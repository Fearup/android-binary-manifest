# android-binary-manifest
Read/Write for binary AndroidManifest.xml (Version Code, Version number)

With this code, you should be able to load a binary AndroidManifest.xml file, to read and change the
visible version name and the version code (used in the play store to detect a new version), and 
to write the changed AndroidManifest.xml to file.
